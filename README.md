# Clustering Universities: Private vs. Public

This project explores the use of **KMeans Clustering** to group universities into two categories: **Private** and **Public**. It demonstrates the application of clustering techniques, data preprocessing, visualization, and evaluation using Python libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

### Features:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations:
  - Scatter plots and histograms for insightful trends.
  - Color-coded clustering results based on attributes.
- Data preprocessing:
  - Handling missing values and normalizing data using `StandardScaler`.
- Model building:
  - Optimal cluster determination using the **Elbow Method** and **KneeLocator**.
  - KMeans clustering with evaluation metrics like the confusion matrix and classification report.
- Hands-on Python code with detailed step-by-step explanations.

 #  Outcomes:
- Clustering efficiency measured against real-world labels (e.g., Private/Public).
- Insights into clustering challenges and potential improvements.
